A Disease-Specific Network Enhancement Prioritization (DiSNEP) framework that enhances a comprehensive gene network for a disease using a gene-gene similarity network derived from a type of omics data of the disease that reflects correlations/interactions between genes for the disease, through a diffusion process.  
  
- The package can be installed through:  
*library("devtools")*    
*install_github("pfruan/DiSNEP")*    
  
or  
  
*directly download the abSNF_1.0.2.tar.gz file and install it locally.*  
  
**Here is an example for how to use the package:** 
  
*library(DiSNEP)*   
  
**Load example dataset.**
  
*data("s0")*   
*data("adjacency")*   
*data("signals")*   

- s0 is a general network, which contains 1000 genes.  
- adjacency is a similarity matrix,which contains 1000 genes.  
- signals is a gene association signals matrix with one column of genes' name and one column of genes' association p values.
    
**Enhance a general network s0 into a disease specific network by diffusion on a similarity network generated from a type of disease omics data.**  
    
*se=diffus_matrix(s0,adjacency,alpha=0.75,iter=10, difference=1e-6)*  

- s0 is the original general gene network.  
- adjacency	is a gene-gene similarity network derived from a type of omics data of a disease.  
- alpha is a regularization parameter representing weights for signal sources where Î± = 0 means no disease-specific enhancement. The default value is 0.75.   
- iter is the number of iterations. The default value is 10.  
- difference	is a parameter for converenge defining when the iteration stops.The default value is 1e-6.  
- the returned se a enhanced gene network.  
  
  
**Denoise the enhanced network and make it binary and symmetric.**
  
*se_post=post_process(se,percent=0.9)*  
  
- se is the enhanced disease specific network. 
- percent is what percentage of edges to be considered as noise. The default value is 0.9.  
- The returned value is a denoised, binary and symmetric gene network.  
  
  
**Prioritize the disease association signals by diffusion process on a gene network**
    
*res=diffus_vec(signals,se_post,type="pvalue", beta=0.75, iter=10, difference=1e-6)*  
  
- t_score is a matrix of original gene signals, with the first colomn is the gene names and the second column is the association signals.  
- snet is a gene network.  
- type indicates the type of input assocaitaion signals, "pvalue" or "zscore". 
- beta is a regularization parameter representing weights for signal sources where beta = 0 means no priotitization. The default value is 0.75.   
- iter is the number of iterations. The default value is 10.    
- difference	is a parameter for converenge defining when the iteration stops.The default value is 1e-6.   
- top is a parameter for how many genes will be selected.
- The returned value is a list of prioritized genes ranked from high to low.
